### **Terminology**
These words are listed and defined to avert confusion and provide clarity for the reader. These definitions apply throughout the entire document, both above and below.
- **Bot:** The application and/or bot account (Sambabe) to which these terms of service apply.
- **Support Server:** The guild/server where official support for the Bot is provided.
- **You(r):** The person in ownership of the user account that uses the Bot.
- **Blacklist(ed):** The restriction that will remove all and total access from the Bot.

<br>

### **Purchase Chargebacks**
Attempting to chargeback a purchased item violates Your agreement with the application, and will result in You being Blacklisted from the bot, as well as a permanent ban from its Support Server. This also includes charging back purchases You have made on another user's account.

<br>

### **Exploiting Bugs and Scripting**
Either scripting or exploiting a glitch or a bug that the Bot may have, for Your own benefit or for others, is not allowed. You will be Blacklisted from the Bot and punished accordingly. Failing to report a glitch or a bug that You see someone else is abusing, will also result in a Blacklist.
