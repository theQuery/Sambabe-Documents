### **Terminology**
These words are listed and defined to avert confusion and provide clarity for the reader. These definitions apply throughout the entire document, both above and below.
- **Bot:** The application and/or bot account (Sambabe) to which this privacy policy applies.
- **Guild:** A guild/server where the Bot is and/or has been present.
- **You(r):** The person in ownership of the user account that uses the Bot.
- **Data:** All the information the Bot has collected from the Data You have directly sent/input to Discord.

<br>

### **Why do we collect Data?**
In order for the Bot to provide fully working functionality in the way that it is expected, the Data listed in the following section needs to be used/stored. You can always delete all the Data the Bot has collected on You by running the `.deletedata` command within the Discord app in the Bot's DM or a Guild.

<br>

### **What Data do we collect, and when?**
All Data the Bot collects is listed below in categories of usage.

- #### **Through Commands**
    The following items may be collected when intentionally provided by You and/or another user through running one of the Bot's commands.

    - Your user account's ID.
    - A Guild's channel ID's.
    - Messages You send in the Discord app.
    - Your user account's member roles in a Guild.
    - Number of times specific commands are used.

    <br>

- #### **Automatically**
    Some of the Bot's functionalities require it to collect Data in intervals and/or upon the Discord app's events (such as when a message is sent). This Data is listed below.

    - Your user account's ID.
    - A Guild's channel ID's.
    - Number of messages You have sent.
    - Number of times You have joined a Guild.
    - Public Discord Data temporarily stored in a cache:
        - Channels.
        - Guilds.
        - Messages.
        - Users.

<br>

### **Where is the Data stored?**
All Data that is permanently stored resides in a password protected database. Temporary Data is stored only within the Bot's cache while it's online and available for You to use. While the Data is securely protected to the best of our abilities, no Data is ever 100% secure, meaning its absolute security cannot be guaranteed. 

<br>

### **Feedback**
All feedback including comments, suggestions, bug reports, and other forms of feedback, that You provide us with in any way, can be changed and/or utilized in any form we deem necessary.

<br>

### **Agreement**
Using the Bot in any way (even by being present in a Guild where the Bot is also present), means You agree with and consent to all the policies listed in this document. If You do not agree with and/or consent to one or more of the listed policies, You may either (as a Guild manager) remove the Bot from the Guild(s), or (as a Guild member) leave the Guild(s) where the Bot is present.
